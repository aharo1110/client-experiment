Experimental web applets client for Capstone project

## Instructions
Just run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`.
Make sure a web applet is also running. Just go to the folder where you have one and type `npm run dev` there.
*(Side note: this expects your applet to run on port 5173)*

The tech stack is totally ad-hoc, this is a first prototype to running actions in applets.
It should work to send actions procedurally (that is without an LLM).
